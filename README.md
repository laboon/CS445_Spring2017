## Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

Sample code under /BST subdirectory

1. SimpleBST.java - A simple implementation of a Binary Tree (no BST restrictions)
2. /height - A simple implementation finding the height of a BT
3. /copy - A simple implementation for recursive copying a BT
4. /traverse - A demo of three different BT traversal algorithms: pre-order, in-order, post-order
5. /nonbinary - An example of an N-tree (a tree where nodes may have an arbitrary (0..N) number of children)
6. /binary_search_array - A demo of searching an array using binary search (just like traversing a binary search tree)
7. /pretty_print - Prints out a Binary Tree
